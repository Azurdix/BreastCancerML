This is a script with several ML algorithms to analyze and predict breast cancer occurrence in a given population. 
Data used in this project is held under open-access and comes from Institute of Oncology, University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, 
Yugoslavia - Zwitter, M. & Soklic, M. (1988). https://doi.org/10.24432/C51P4M. 
Three models were applied: Random Forest, Pruned Forest and Neural Network. 
Small visualizations and reports included in the code. 
This was done as a part of small semestral-assignment for my Postgraduate Degree in Artificial Intelligence in Data Analysis (University of Economics in Katowice). 
I upload it, because it received a good grade.

Dislaimers:

You might want to edit file paths to suit your own personal computing machine

You might want to translate my step-by-step comments from Polish to English.
